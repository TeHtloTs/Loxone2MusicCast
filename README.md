Hi Human.

I have an apartment whit KNX sensors/actuators and ceiling speakers from Yamaha, connected to an EBAY amplifier sourced from an WXAD-10.
The main goal for this project is to automatically play the radio in my bedroom every (work-) morning and let the radio follow me to the bathroom and kitchen.
Then eventually stop playing when I'm gone.
